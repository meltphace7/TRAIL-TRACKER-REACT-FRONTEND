    description: `This is a very challenging but scenic hike that will take you along an abandoned road along the Klickitat river.  Half way through the hike you make an offtrail ascent through Oak savanah to the top of the canyon.  From there you navigate a series of old logging roads to a spectacular vista/waterfall high above the Klickitat river.`,
